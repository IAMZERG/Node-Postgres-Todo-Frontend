# Postgres-todo

This is a simple front-end for a todo list app that was built based on a tutorial found at http://mherman.org/blog/2015/02/12/postgresql-and-nodejs/#.VcuIFETd_0o

However, instead of being a good little boy and following along with the tutorial in Angular, I decided to do it in Ember.js.
